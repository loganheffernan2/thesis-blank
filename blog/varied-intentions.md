      Notions of data privacy and the state-centric surveillance apparatus
      permeate the work of Netherlands-based Metahaven, another definitive
      speculative design studio. Speculative design often engages only vaguely
      with a society’s prominent systems of power and control, gesturing toward
      disparity while carefully circumventing any directly political statement.
      Metahaven partially resolves that shortcoming, setting its sights on work
      that—while still speculative—engages critically with present realities.
      Established in 2007 by Vinca Kruk and Daniel van der Velden, Metahaven’s
      most visible work is 2010’s “Uncorporate Identity,” a 600-page tomb
      exploring the ways in which design becomes a tool for state-making and
      (extremely) late capitalism. Kruk and van der Velden, who also both
      supplement their income with teaching positions, proclaim Metahaven a
      research-intensive design practice. In “Imagined Communities,” Benedict
      Anderson writes of print capitalism, postulating that it was only through
      access to the printing press that modern nationalism rose. The wide
      dissemination of printed materials connected localities under a shared
      discourse, a shared language. “Uncorporate Identity” expounds on
      Anderson’s notions through a study of modern identity; the passport
      represents a design artifact that denotes citizenship and grants movement
      to its holder, well-branded technology giants usurp agency from both the
      individual and the state. Statehood and brandhood seek to provide
      immediate shared interests with which the individual can identify and
      coalesce under. In undertaking this work, Metahaven reaches beyond its
      immediate design fandom into a world concerned with financialization and
      neofascism. There is no relinquishing of their graphic language, a
      hyper-online pastiche of conventionally low-brow aesthetics, but there
      remains resonance even for those less interested in the image-packed
      spreads. Image: Metahaven's "Uncorporate Identity"

  - desc: "In a metropolitan area such as New York City, graphic design often divides itself between four modes of practice. There are designers who work within small studios, designers who spend their days with larger agencies, designers who operate as independent freelancers, and designers who are brought in-house. Size constitutes the primary difference between the studio and the agency; while studios often employ teams of ten people or fewer, agencies span continents—Pentagram, the most mythologized of these machines, operates across five international locations and consists of 25 partners. While studios are oft perceived as a respite for those weary of implanting themselves within the gears of a Pentagram-like corporate firm, the structures share largely-similar operational methodologies. Both the studio and the agency provide their services to industry—though, as is important to remember, so does most labor. In contrast with the agenda-driven work of speculative practice, commercial design of all aforementioned scale prioritizes solvency. The studio practitioner and in-house art director are both tasked with providing market-ready visual content (read: advertising). Though design practice has done its best to extricate its formal artifacts from the economic structures they are produced within, such liberation is certainly impossible. Trade publications like Ad Age push for the insulation of the creative professions as innovative and benevolent by announcing annual lists and awards. Diversity becomes leveraged as brand-speak—representation matters only insofar as it lets folx of all identities see themselves in roles of consumption. Campaigns aim to connect with as broad of audiences as possible in favor of attractive quarterly reports. Pfizer virtue-signalling with rainbow pride logo renditions is taken as alibi-enough to gloss over the $959,263 donated by the pharma giant to 52 anti-LGBT legislators from 2017–2018.  \tNearly all commercial graphic design practice fundamentally resists critique of capitalism. Design confined to marketing performance peddles the products of exploited labor to the benefit of the capitalist class. The culture industry froths with excess; commodity offerings placate the alienated working class and hegemony remains intact. The consumer is continually reproduced onto themselves as the colonial capitalist assuages their unease with any burgeoning demand for a redistribution of capital."

Graphic design feels familiar to most; it adorns t-shirts, posters, bus stops, billboards. It is relatively easy to identify the field’s artifact-based output. <span class="contentNote">(1)</span> However, this very ubiquity also presents an immense challenge when attempting to understand graphic design on a disciplinary level. There is design created for commercial purposes, design created for governmental purposes, design created to inform, design created to deceive—this familiar world is that of exploitive production and hegemonic culture industries. Within the field’s splintered lodging also dwells speculative or—more problematically—critical design.

<br/>

Speculative design, coined by Anthony Dunne but existing long before, concerns itself with imagined futures. Dunne remains highly responsible for popularizing the “critical” and “speculative” design vernacular. The former was introduced in 1999’s “Hertzian Tales,” <span class="contentNote">(2)</span> the latter in “Speculative Everything,” published in 2013 and co-authored by Fiona Raby. Both texts are claimed under the umbrella of Dunne & Raby, the collaborative studio established by the pair of designers in 1994. Their work runs full-bore through the absurd; 2005’s “Evidence Dolls” performs as self-proclaimed cultural commentary—the work took shape as 25 unique male dolls with a DNA compartment (read: miniature and museum-friendly sperm banks). <span class="contentNote">(3)</span> At its best, this operational methodology reframes design practice to challenge fundamental socioeconomic and political structures. At its worst, speculative design is better understood with yet another of its many names: design fiction. As the current global landscape of info-capitalism continues to further assimilate itself to imagined dystopias of generations past, an unwavering interest in fictional futures seems ever more demanding of critical examination.

<br/>

One of the issues posed by graphic design’s blurry disciplinary container is a lack of critical framework. There is little formal relation between a state-distributed health pamphlet and a sign-post gig flyer, a mall-chain t-shirt and a pharmaceutical label. Without a general consensus regarding the ways graphic design performs and operates, critique wades through aesthetic alibis, ardent defenses of style. However, even this meta-critique must be scoured for shortcomings; demanding that all graphic design labor is poured into movement-oriented work again requires agreement on what agenda is being served by these outcomes.

Asking who is behind the work remains imperative in locating the social and cultural conditions that allow—or demand—it. This understanding in turn lies at the core of the work’s intent; it defines the difference between meaningful impact and virtue signaling, self-aware critique and exploitive complicity. Though the most masturbatory of graphic design work may succeed in building its own vacuum of existence, the vast majority of work produced by both pragmatic and speculative practitioners does, in fact, reach a substantial audience.

<br/>

Whether design initiative aims to assist in the creation of support networks for marginalized communities or postulate on the conditioning factors of work done in a post- or anti-capitalist societies, failing to recognize the current socioeconomic state and its operational confines often signals a lingering fetishization of the institutions that created today’s hellscape. Pratt Institute’s “Free School” <span class="contentNote">(4)</span> program provides tuition-free graphic design courses to members of Pratt’s surrounding communities, but this initiative implicitly posits that offering these classes as a way to lessen the Othering of the neighborhood’s occupants is the most meaningful use of the institution’s resources in a reparatoy context. An analysis rooted in inquiries of intent and privilege creates a framework within which the myriad modes of contemporary design practice can be both celebrated and critiqued, within which there may lie clues in constructing an actionable route to more meaningful practice across the board.

<br/>

In a 2017 interview with RUKI Journal, Dunne describes the studio’s conception as having grown from experiences he and Raby shared while working in Japan during the late 1980s and early 1990s. <span class="contentNote">(5)</span> He remembers finishing his office days at Sony and joining Fiona to pour over the work of her employer, Kei’ichi Irie Architects. Citing the inspiring breadth of applications the studio found for its work—both realized and conceptual—Dunne and Ruby returned to the UK and established their eponymous studio as an avenue upon which to explore design removed from a commercial setting and situated within imagined futures. The studio has since produced dozens of projects, and, though perhaps best known for their writings, many of these projects have centered around exhibition-oriented artifact production. They attribute this orientation to a desire to carry their work beyond the walls of academia.

<br/>

Speaking at Strelka Institute in 2017, Dunne reasoned, “For us, the most important thing is that our ideas do connect with designers who are doing design, teachers who are teaching design, researchers who are researching, and they don’t just stay academic.” <span class="contentNote">(6)</span> Referring to the aforementioned criteria regarding the reach and context of differing modes of design practice, this statement provides rich insight into the Dunne & Raby ethos. To provide further context, both Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby have held various teaching positions for the duration of the studio’s existence. Both have occupied multiple faculty roles at London’s Royal College of Art, most notably their decade-long (2005–2015) stint running the Design Interactions program. While these positions have provided the working capital to keep Dunne & Raby afloat, they have also informed the studio’s gravitation toward institutionalized design dialogue. Though citing the need to share work with those outside of academia, the studio paints their image of this expanded audience as still consisting of professional designers operating within research, academic, or commercial spaces. Though any purity test under capitalism is doomed to fail, it is important to note this appeal in its exclusion of the non-designer public—or, rather, the non-accredited-designer public.

<br/>

An artifact-based practice cannot be cited without inclusion of said artifacts. “Hertzian Tales” is presented on Dunne & Raby’s web portfolio as the studio’s earliest work, and it’s critique of technocracy aligns with speculative design’s larger thematic interest in technology as power. “Hertzian Tales,” packaged and distributed as a book, consists of four separate speculative objects; The Faraday Chair, The Pillow, Tuneable Cities, and The Thief of Affections. The most applied of these studies was Tuneable Cities—where other explorations resulted in mock fabrications, Tuneable Cities materialized as a radio scanner able to receive audio signals from baby monitoring systems and other home broadcasting devices. <span class="contentNote">(7)</span> When driven around London, it provided data that could be overlayed against a street map to show the “domestic soundscapes leaked through wireless babycoms” (Dunne & Raby). The stated intent behind the project was to explore ways in which the car, primarily seen as isolating its occupants from the world around it, could instead function as a place of connectivity. The unstated outcome was a demonstration of how privacy-compromised commodity technology has rendered many households. Among the less pragmatic approaches and explorations of “Hertzian Tales,” Tuneable Cities shows how speculative design was able to raise eyebrows about data privacy years before the Patriot Act severely compromised the American people’s right to data sovereignty.

<br/>

While Dunne & Raby’s “Speculative Everything” may earn real estate on a BFA syllabus, the student reading it is unlikely to graduate from their institution and become an auteur of celebrated conceptual work. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there are nearly 300,000 trained graphic designers working within the United States <span class="contentNote">(8)</span>—and, though many design professionals enjoy depicting themselves as members of some elite “creative class,” the totalizing nature of capitalism ensures that their labor inescapably fuels alienating commodity production. Instead, they face assimilation into an ever-whirring culture industry that values them as much as the next graduate with technical proficiency in Adobe’s Creative Cloud programs.

<br/>

However, labor is not without the potential to challenge the superstructure. The graphic designer dislodges their labor from economies of exploitation when they apply their formal skills to varied performances, such as agitprop. The Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America (OSPAAAL) provides a case study in which visual vernacular developed around decolonial struggle. <span class="contentNote">(9)</span> Founded 1966, Havana-based OSPAAAL stood as a transnational front against a then-nascent neoliberalism. On a quarterly schedule, the socialist organization published Tricontinental, a magazine connecting marginalized peoples across the world. OSPAAL’s rich visual history is apparent in the online archives that host its posters. In the spirit of global solidarity, OSPAAAL posters were designed in languages appropriate for their areas of distribution; language represents the primary epistemic device with which nationalism is wrought, and producing work that spans perceived language barriers represents immediate and pragmatic praxis. Design labor poured into a movement like OSPAAAL differs greatly from that poured into agency hours. The aesthetics of agitation root themselves in urgency and community; grassroots organization takes into account epistemologies of the oppressed. As Audre Lord famously declared, “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” No multinational powerhouse can launch a philanthropic initiative deceptive enough to veil their utter dependence on racial capitalism.

<br/>

Both speculative and pragmatic design applications weave through institutional boundaries. These modes of practice embed themselves within academia and economics, blockaded by debt-incurring tuition and the inherent compromises of capitalist production. In accounting for the gears of these machines, a clear similarity is the importance of the Other. By positioning itself as a research-reliant mode of practice, speculative design demarcates the initiated designer against the uninitiated public. The designer-researcher creates their own counter-academia, a space with politics both inherited and of its own conception. Inclusivity, one of corporate culture’s most coveted marketing check-boxes, holds new meaning in this context.

<br/>

If critical practice looks beyond the confines of market economics, it must work to level academic gatekeeping, too. In “The Practice of Everyday Life,” Michel de Certeau writes of strategies and tactics. <span class="contentNote">(10)</span> Strategies refer to the modes of operation prescribed by the producer class. Strategies enforce hegemony and are dictated by institutional power. Tactics respond to strategies—tactics are the decisions made and actions carried out by the consumer class, subversive and representative of a motion to reclaim agency sapped by dominant institutions. The division between these two operational codes rests on a distinction between consumption and product; the producer class is only able to retain its power while its consumers continue to use its commodity and service offerings. Bureaucracy must be rejected whenever possible, and gatekeeping must meet a fast death. As speculative design makes clear its interest in institutional departure, it must mindfully shift from operating within a framework of strategies to one of tactics. Fully-realized speculative design is intersectional; if speculation is to be a tool for future world-building, it must dialogue with a broader spectrum of submerged voices.

<br/>

This is not to say that every speculative practitioner should rush toward ill-implemented identity politics, but criticality that only reaches as far as arm’s length from the White European designer should be questioned. In early 2014 James Auger, a prominent figure within speculative design and a graduate of Dunne and Raby’s RCA program, wrote, “What is this obsession with class systems? The UK may have its financial problems but most of us stopped obsessing about these divides in the distant past.” <span class="contentNote">(11)</span> This post, a comment on a MoMA Interactive Exhibition page titled “Design and Violence,” was responding to another comment critiquing speculative practice. <span class="contentNote">(12)</span> The comment Auger saw as so inflamtory read, in part, “Show any of the projects in this exhibition to a non-white, non upper middle-class, third world public and they will laugh. Nothing about them is in the least unsettling to such an audience, although it might be absurd. Again, we’re talking about this being for a white, middle class American audience, so perhaps this is what white middle class Americans find shocking. What I find more shocking than the pieces themselves is that this is what white middle class Americans are supposed to find unsettling.”

<br/>

Though posted anonymously, the author of the critical comment responded to Auger by identifying themselves as Ahmed, a designer from Karachi, Pakistan. Ahmed expounds upon their critique of SCD, Speculative and Critical Design, questioning where its political accountability lies. The futures it clamors over depict generalized dystopias in which whole societies are affected in a uniform manner. Speculative design must dislodge itself from its privileged and reactionary considerations. SCD must consider gender, it must consider race, it must consider labor. Such dialogue is more than possible—it is already heavily present in critical studies of the non-design variety. In her “Cyborg Manifesto,” Donna Haraway uses the fictional cyborg figure to probe deeper into an investigation of subjugated and dominant voices. <span class="contentNote">(13)</span> The cyborg becomes a proxy through which to consider alternative epistemologies; rather than using this fictional character to argue for some transcendent discarding of identity, the cyborg perspective is one through which the nuanced problematics of sectarian social liberation movements can be better clarified. Speculative design must commit itself to this work rather than scurrying behind the artifact-as-alibi.

<br/>

Commercial, immediately-applicable performances of design present their own challenges when considering the ways in which to excavate them from structures of exploitation. Much of the operational criteria for this work—for example, an unavoidable need to generate profit—resists modification without massive structural change. The graphic designer embedded within corporate machinery is tasked with helping to manufacture consent. Within these workspaces, “representation” is one of many perverted buzzwords employed to gloss over the fact that girl-boss capitalism does nothing to dismantle dominant hierarchies or distribute power. The hope for graphic design comes in the form of its less-commercial civic performances. Though the classification of civic arrives upon a lineage of nationalism, it is used here to denote that which relates to a municipality through either institutional action or grass-roots organizing. In this space, design’s communicative potential is reclaimed from its polished commercial strategization. Graphic design is realized as counter-hegemonic when it serves local politicians with leftist platforms, when it helps community organizations spread their messaging and coalition-build. Graphic design is realized as counter-hegemonic when it puts its aesthetics aside for a moment and asks how it can help; in the project that became a contact zone for Ahmed and James Auger, SCD projecting a future of famine looks past its own absolute tone-deafness in order to create a quasi-daring smirk-in-the-mind.

<br/>

The performances of graphic design vary greatly from its most capital-loving, commodity-producing, design-thinking corporate use to its most radical, constituency-gathering, critical applications. The dialogue between speculative and pragmatic practice bears the most fruit when the two are able to criticize each other while maintaining self-awareness. Speculative/critical/fictional design provides a window through which to postulate visions of the world ahead; if SCD practice is able to move beyond its privileged reliance on the design object and imbue itself with the deeper dialogues traversed in critical theory, speculative design may provide a toolkit for more immediate pragmatic action. Likewise, the tightly-bound confines of pragmatic practice provide ground upon which to rethink the ways graphic design participates in structural oppression and ponders possible departure points from this dominant narrative. By reeling an ever-amorphous field into a loose set of working criteria, a blurry disciplinary container can catalyze movement toward new modes of practice.
