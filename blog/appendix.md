      Mentioned in multiple interviews, Evening Class describes itself as "an
      experiment in self-organised education that has been active since January
      2016. It's a space where we can cultivate common interests, develop
      research and collectively decide the classâ€™s programme. Our programme
      takes the form of public workshops, talks and debates, reading groups,
      radio broadcasting, performances, walks, and publishing." Though currently
      based in London, Evening Class provides a blueprint for the implementation
      of similar initiatives within other communities.

      "Extra-curricular" also found its way into multiple conversations from the
      original "Where Are We?" interviews. Published initially as a book,
      "Extra-curricular" centers itself around the exploration of alternative
      art and design education practices.

      This reading list served as the catalyst for this work. There are many
      propositions for new modes of learning and working within the linked
      resources.

As touched upon in numerous conversations, the current landscape of institutional design pedagogy is not without alternatives. While BFA and MFA programs may dominate the learning experiences of most practicing designers, these curriculums do not represent the totality of the available options.

<br/>

Compiled here is an ever-growing list of supplemental resources, from reading lists to syllabi to self-organized continuing education initiatives.

<br/>

Please reach out if you have any additions for this resource. As a whole, "Where Are We" has no set end-point. It is my hope that the resources will continue to grow; whether compiled here or in additional interviews and workshops, this body of work intends to absorb all that it can and present a flexible tool with moments of resonance for all who visit.

<br/>

Thank you for engaging.
