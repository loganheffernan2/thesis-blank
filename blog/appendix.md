      "Black Mountain College was an experimental college founded in 1933 by
      John Andrew Rice, Theodore Dreier, and several others. Based in Black
      Mountain, North Carolina, the school was ideologically organized around
      John Dewey's principles of education, which emphasized holistic learning
      and the study of art as central to a liberal arts education."

      "In 1961 Roy Ascott established his first “Groundcourse” at Eailing Art
      School. An experiment in radical pedagogy, Groundcourse methodically
      applied cybernetic theories concerning systemic relations, communication,
      interactivity, participation and feedback to an everyday art school
      environment."

      reconstructs the arguments and succession of events that led to the
      occupation of Hornsey College of Art between May and July 1968."

      "The Werkplaats Typografie (WT), a part of the ArtEZ University of the
      Arts, is a two-year graphic design masters programme founded in 1998 by
      Karel Martens and Wigger Bierma. The WT is centered on assignments and
      self-initiated projects with lectures, seminars, meetings and readings
      geared towards self-accountable and independently motivated work and
      research."

While design education may be centralized within institutions like Pratt, there have been myriad responses to institutional shortcomings regarding rising discourses of ethics and responsibility. Both IRL and URL groups have formed in response to the urgent need for politicized design pedagogy.

<br/>

The 20th century played host to a wave of counter-institutional learning; perhaps the most famous of these experimental ventures was Black Mountain college, an alternative university with a co-operative ethos and ambitions to dissolve student-teacher hierarchies. <span class="contentNote">(1)</span> New models of teaching were tested in Roy Ascott’s “Groundcourse,” <span class="contentNote">(2)</span> and student insurrection roared at London’s Hornsey College of Art <span class="contentNote">(3)</span>. Though these three examples represent no single attitude, they underscore an understated-but-constant dialogue between the student body and their institution. Radical pedagogy resists stasis, and all parties involved must commit themselves to the project of learning.

<br/>

Not all design education programs have resisted the changing global landscape. Tucked away in the Netherlands, Werkplaats Typografie <span class="contentNote">(4)</span> and the Sandberg Instituut <span class="contentNote">(5)</span> are often lauded as counter-commercial programs focused on instilling within their students critical approaches to design practice.

<br/>

Smaller local initiatives have cropped up across the world. In Los Angeles, the Southland Institute “is dedicated to exploring, identifying, and implementing meaningful, affordable, sustainable alternatives in design and art education in the United States.” <span class="contentNote">(6)</span> In New York, spaces like SSHH <span class="contentNote">(7)</span> and XXXI offer opportunities to enroll in single or multiple session courses trained around specific creative skill sets. London’s Evening Class <span class="contentNote">(8)</span> approaches topics like unionization and post-capitalist desire through self-organized working groups, and Chicago-published Extra-curricular <span class="contentNote">(9)</span> speculates on new models for design learning. As larger institutions hopefully begin to reevaluate their design curricula, peer-organized learning continues to open space for missing conversations.

<br/>

In approaching this initial “Where Are We?” work, I found that much of the framework that proved helpful for considering new design pedagogy came from beyond the immediate scope of the design field. I have compiled these resources (along with more design-centric content) on a microsite, directly linking full texts when possible. <span class="contentNote">(10)</span>

<br/>

Though this body of work was initiated as my undergraduate capstone, I truly hope to continue pushing “Where Are We?” as a collaborative publishing platform. If you are interested in getting involved, please reach out! I would love to share this space for our collective musings on graphic design practice. <span class="contentNote">(11)</span>
